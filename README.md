<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Stay In Tarkov (SIT) is a Escape From Tarkov mod designed for cooperative play.

Stay In Tarkov is currently under development by a small team of developers. While SIT is playable, there are many bugs, synchronization and performance issues during gameplay. Escape From Tarkov and SPT-AKI updates frequently and oftentimes, your progress must be reset.

In other words, SIT is not a perfect replacement of the live experience: always keep in mind that game breaking bugs and progression issues will occur and there are no way around it.
